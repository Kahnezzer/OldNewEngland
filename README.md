# Old New England

Old New England is a modlist built for the players, not the creator. With over 1,000 mods, it’s grounded in organization and stability. It’s Fallout 4 with smarter systems, better encounters, and a Commonwealth that actually feels lived in. Every area has been improved and expanded without unnecessary bloat.

## Disclaimer
**If you alter the list it hinders my ability to diagnose and solve issues you may encounter.**

## Focused around three core areas most players notice first

- **Leveling & Perks** — smarter progression and meaningful choices  
- **Combat** — tighter fights, better AI, and more tactical encounters  
- **Visuals** — lighting, weather, and textures that support immersion without performance bloat

---

2. Select Fallout 4 and tick **Non-Featured**.  
3. Scroll to **Old New England** and click **Install**.  
4. Choose an install location (avoid Program Files, Steam folders, or other system locations).  
5. Let Wabbajack download and configure everything.  
6. In the install folder, open the **Tools** folder, run **BethINI**, and set your preferences.  
7. Launch **ModOrganizer.exe** from the install folder and start Fallout 4 through MO2.

## First Launch

1. Create your character and leave the cryo chamber.  
2. Pick your skills and traits. I recommend choosing **Custom** instead of **Default** — it gives more control over leveling and starting stats.  
3. Head toward the vault exit while the game finishes loading. After the elevator, pick your Gun-for-Hire settings and let quests finish initializing.  
4. Open Modular Configuration Menu (MCM) and load the **Old New England Preset** via **MCM Settings Manager**.  
5. Choose **Remove NW's Grenade Rules** when prompted.  
6. Adjust personal settings as needed.  
7. Save, then reload that save to finalize certain MCM changes.  
8. Play.

## MCM Setup

Most options are pre-set, but you may want to tweak these:

- **True Damage** — scale combat damage if fights feel too harsh or too easy.  
- **Survival Options** — toggle needs mechanics and how frequently they apply.  
- **Volume Sliders** — balance sound levels to taste.  
- **Custom Camera** — tweak angle and distance for preferred view.

## Key Mods

A short list of what matters most in this build:

- **True Damage** — challenging combat without creating bullet sponges.  
- **S7 (Skyrim Skill Overhaul)** — skill XP tied to use, for more organic progression.  
- **Karma & Challenges** — systems that echo classic Fallout mechanics.  
- **Visual Suite** — Reactor ENB, NAC X, ELFX + Ultra Interior/Exterior Lighting (properly ordered and patched).  
- **Quest Expansions** — America Rising 2, Tales from the Commonwealth, CSEP Presents Loaded Bases, Brothers in Arms: Return Of The Outcasts, Nuka-World Reborn Trilogy, and more.  
- **Dungeons & Locations** — Vault 117, Nordic Europa Research Facility, and other handcrafted sites.  
- **Player Homes** — The Shack (starter home near Sanctuary Bridge), Survivalist’s Bus, Concord Hideout, etc.
