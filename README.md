# Old New England – Installation Guide

This guide walks you through installing **Old New England** using **Wabbajack**.  
Follow it exactly. Deviations make troubleshooting difficult and unsupported.

---

## Requirements (Read First)

Before installing, make sure you have:

- **A fresh Fallout 4 install**
  - All DLC required
  - **Do NOT install the HD Texture Pack**
- **Nexus Mods Premium** (strongly recommended)
- **~280 GB free disk space** for installation and downloads  
  - Final install size is smaller after cleanup
- **Visual C++ Redistributables (All-in-One)** installed
- Fallout 4 installed **outside Program Files**

> This list is large and heavily curated. Stability depends on correct setup.

## Hardware Recommendations

Old New England is not lightweight.

- **CPU:** Modern quad-core minimum  
  (6–8 core recommended for best stability)
- **GPU:** 8 GB VRAM minimum  
  (10–12 GB VRAM recommended)
- **RAM:** 16 GB minimum  
  (32 GB recommended)
- **Storage:** SSD required  
  (NVMe strongly recommended)
- **OS:** Windows 10 / 11 (64-bit)

Fallout 4 is often CPU-limited. Performance will vary by location, weather, and combat density.

## Step 1 – Install Wabbajack

- Download Wabbajack from the official site
- Run Wabbajack and set a **dedicated install folder**
  - Example: `D:\Wabbajack`
  - Do **not** install in Program Files

---

## Step 2 – Install Old New England

- Open Wabbajack
- Select **Browse Modlists**
- Choose **Fallout 4**
- Enable **Show Non-Featured Lists**
- Select **Old New England**
- Click **Install**

When prompted:

- Choose a **clean, empty install directory**
  - Example: `D:\OldNewEngland`
- Choose a **separate downloads folder**
  - Example: `D:\WabbajackDownloads`

Let Wabbajack complete the installation.  
This can take a while — that’s normal.

---

## Step 3 – First Launch Setup

After Wabbajack finishes:

- Open the install folder
- Run **ModOrganizer.exe**
- **Do not enable or disable anything except optional mods at the bottom**
- Launch Fallout 4 **through Mod Organizer**

---

## Step 4 – In-Game Initialization (Important)

- Start a **new game**
- Create your character
- Exit **Vault 111**
- Wait several minutes for the game to initialize
  - You may see pop-ups
  - This is normal

Once things settle:

- Open **MCM (Mod Configuration Menu)**
- Open **MCM Settings Manager**
- Load the **Old New England preset**

After applying settings:

- Save your game
- Fully exit Fallout 4
- Relaunch and continue playing

---

## Optional Adjustments

After the first successful load, you may tweak:

- Difficulty and survival options
- Sound balance
- Camera preferences
- HUD scaling

These are **personal preference** and safe to adjust.

---

## Important Notes

- **Do not modify the modlist**
- **Do not remove mods**
- **Do not reorder plugins**
- **Do not add additional mods**

If you change the list, support becomes extremely limited.

This modlist relies on:

- Pre-generated archives (LOD, TexGen, Facegen, Cubemaps)
- Curated patch stacks
- A tightly controlled load order

Changes break that balance.
