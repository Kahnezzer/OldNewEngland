## First Launch

1. Create your character and leave the cryo-chamber 
2. Pick you Skills and Traits. I reccomend choosing custom instead of deafult, it allows you more control over leveling and starting stats.
3. Head towards the vault exit while things load. After riding elevator up pic your Gun Fore Hire settings and let the quests finish loading.
